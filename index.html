title: Dave's 42% Picks.
---

<div id="home">
	<p>In 2013 I had a return of <a href="/summary/2013/">42%</a> and honed my selection system. I expect another market beating return in 2014 and I've decided to share my picks with you. I share my weekly selections with subscribers an hour after the market opens (typically 10:30 AM ET). To trade similarly to my account you'll need: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>An <a href="http://oh.tellapal.com/a/clk/22Dppg">Options House account</a> I use Options House because they have low fees and allow selling covered puts.</li>
		<li>About $90,000 in your account - I currently hold 4 positions per week and when my account hits $100,000 I plan on holding 5 positions per week.</li>
		<li>To subscribe to this blog. Old picks will available for free on Saturdays, at which point the picks are not actionable.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		 If you don't have an Options House account go ahead and <a href="http://oh.tellapal.com/a/clk/22Dppg">open one</a> for free. If you don't have $90,000 sorry, I can't help you there. If you have less, the information I provide may still be valuable, but you will not be able to follow the trades I'm making.</p>
